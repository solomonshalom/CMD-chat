# CMD Chat
An chat application made in python that can be used in the command line, the code can support multiple clients on one server. The application also allows you to change the IP and Port of your server.

# Prerequisite

- Atom/Visual Studio Code

The main part of coding, an IDE. I would recommand, [Atom](https://github.com/atom) or [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode). The reason I would recommand this IDE because of it's ease of access and tons of extensions.

- Python
Python is necessary for the code to run as it is built upon python. To download it, simply download the installer and install all the files such as PIP and other required files/extensions. 

# Server IP and Port
The current ip address used for the server is ```127.0.0.1``` and Port ```7976```. The IP and Port can be changed, but if they are changed then client-side's IP and Port should also be changed to the IP address and Port of the server side in order to work properly. Also, note that in order of it to work you/anyone should be hosting the server-side code and the people who want to chat, the client-side code.

# Running The Code
To run the code, open the command line in the file directory and type ```python Client-Side.py``` this should activate the code and turn your command line to the client based command line which means you can now send messages to people who are connected to the server.
